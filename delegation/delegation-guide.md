# Delegation Guide

Restaker deposits SOL into sSOL. They delegate sSOL into different e-AVS to help them secure “blockspace”. The more stake they have, the more likelihood an application can get their transactions through. This is similar to AWS, where developers pay for storage and RAM to have the highest performance for users. Here, e-AVS bids for stake to guarantee more blockspace and transaction inclusion.

**Step 1:** Select a protocol to delegate your stake to in order to enhance its performance and security.&#x20;
