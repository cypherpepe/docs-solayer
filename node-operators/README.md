# Node Operators

Node operators can be an individual or organization that have the set up required to opt-into the distributed systems across the Solayer network. Node operators are delegated with the restaked LST or native staked SOL to perform operations, and in return to be rewarded, or slashed if there is misbehavior.&#x20;



Solayer is approaching the node operator design in two categories: **general-purpose**, **sidecar-specific**. This is to efficiently:&#x20;

1. efficiently scale the network by distributing the workload&#x20;
2. categorize responsibilities between general-purpose and sidecar-specific node operator
3. avoid patterns of long-tail sidecars and node operators&#x20;
4. optimized for specific tasks, such as transaction sequencing to improve performance&#x20;
