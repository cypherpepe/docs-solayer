# LST Restaking

As of April 1st, 2024, a significant portion of Solana's tokens are participating in liquid staking, with $2.29 billion worth of SOL having been liquid staked. Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) included in Solayer's restaking infrastructure will be released in phases. The initial ones are listed below:

* SOL
* Marinade-SOL (mSOL)
* JITO-SOL (JITO-SOL)
* Blaze-SOL (bSOL)
* Infinity-SOL (INF)

Solayer will monitor for other potential LSTs to be added to the restaking bucket. Please reach out to team@solayer.org if there is room for collaboration. We will release the SIP (Solayer Improvement Proposal) as a mechanism for LST additions.&#x20;
