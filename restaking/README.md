# Restaking&#x20;

Solana uses Proof of Stake and Proof of History consensus, allowing participants to stake assets for the chance to validate network activities according to protocol rules. Dishonest validators risking spurious activity can have their stakes slashed by others. Validators are rewarded with additional tokens for contributing to network security.

Restaking allows stakers of SOL or Liquid Staked SOL to participate in "delegated consensus". They restake their assets into Solayer restaking vault, and delegate to a group of operators, who then opt-into other networks to validate and earn rewards.&#x20;
