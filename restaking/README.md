# Restaking&#x20;

On decentralized blockchain networks secured by proof-of-stake, such as Ethereum and Solana, participants have the ability to _stake_ some of their assets into the network. In exchange, they receive the opportunity to validate that the activity on the network behaves according to some set of rules that comprise the network's protocol. If one of these validators attempts to declare spurious activity as genuine, other validators can destroy the dishonest validator's staked assets. Validators are rewarded with more digital assets by the protocol for their contribution to the security of the network.

On some of these proof-of-stake networks, validators can use an application-layer _restaking_ system to opt-in to validate activity against additional sets of rules that define additional protocols. These protocols can provide validators with more rewards than they would otherwise earn by solely validating for the network's base protocol. If validators break the additional rules they agreed to, other participants in the restaking system can destroy their restaked assets.

Constructing an AVS as a protocol secured by a restaking system sidesteps many of the hurdles it might face, as outlined in the previous section. This reduces the barriers to entry for new AVSs, creating the conditions for exiciting innovation to happen.
