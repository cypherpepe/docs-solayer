**Step 6**: At a given point of withdrawal, a portion of the points will be penalized before the launch of node operators&#x20;



## Withdrawal guide

Withdrawal will be enabled by the start of April. Withdrawals prior to the maturity date will incur a points penalty. For withdrawing natively staked SOL, just like with other LSTs, your assets will first be transferred to your own stake account, which will then get deactivated before you can retrieve the SOL.

**Step 1: You can see your total restaked asset in the table view**&#x20;
