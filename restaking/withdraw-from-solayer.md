# Withdraw from Solayer

Withdrawals like in other staking systems are delayed by an epoch to ensure that delegated funds are fully out of the system and the AVS remains secure during the withdrawals. Native staked SOL withdrawals are limited to the underlying withdrawal delay from the Solana blockchain and Solayer epoch delay will be added on top of any underlying delays.

**Withdrawal Activation**

To ensure the healthiness of the protocool and smooth experience of withdrawing native SOL, Solayer will enable withdrawal between Epoch 1 - 5, before the release of sSOL. The SOL restaked will be locked while earning native and MEV yield in addition to restaking provided yield. The maximum lock period will be 1 month.&#x20;



**Unbounding period on Solayer**&#x20;

After restaking on Solayer programs, there will be an average 2 day unbounding period after initiating the unstaking process, whether LST or native restaking. Secondly, before the process of delegation is released, any withdrawal from the restaking layer will incur a penalty in the points accrued based on time weighting and amount unstaked.&#x20;
