# Native Staked SOL Restaking

The majority of the staked sol currently comes from direct staking instead of the LSTs, this means that users who have directly staked are a big market for solayer and their yields can be increased with delegating to an AVS operator in solayer. This is achieved via working with existing validators to support a one click restaking option where the user can send a transaction to solayers contracts which allows the validator to use their stake for re-staking as well earning the user additional rewards.
