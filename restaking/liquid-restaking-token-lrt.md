# Liquid Restaking Token (LRT)

In the coming year, Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) are anticipated to play a significant role in the Solana ecosystem, building on the momentum established by Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) in recent years. We propose the introduction of a standard, similar to ERC4626 authored by Joey Santoro, that will enable the seamless integration of LRTs into the Solana DeFi ecosystem. This standard will allow users to leverage their LRT holdings by borrowing additional funds or swapping LRTs for LSTs without the need for withdrawal. The adoption of the LRT standard is expected to facilitate the incorporation of new LRTs into DeFi protocols, such as Drift Protocol, Margin Finance, etc.&#x20;
