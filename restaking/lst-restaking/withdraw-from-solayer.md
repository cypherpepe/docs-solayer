# Withdraw from Solayer

**Unbounding period on Solayer**&#x20;

After restaking on Solayer programs, there will be a 7 day unbounding period after initiating the unstaking process, whether LST or native restaking. Secondly, before the process of delegation is released, any withdrawal from the resetaking layer will incur a penalty in the points accrued based on time weighting and amount unstaked.&#x20;

**Step 1: You can see your total restaked asset in the table view**&#x20;
