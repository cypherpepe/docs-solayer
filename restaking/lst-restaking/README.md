  Restaking LSTs involves transferring liquid staking tokens into the Solayer
  restaking program. By doing so, you are opting into the shared security layer
  to securing other distributed layers.

# LST Restaking

LST is a major component for the restaking layer. Solana, at the time of writing (April 1st, 2024), has $2.29B SOL liquid staked out of $53B (total circulating value) = 4.3% of SOL is liquid staked.&#x20;

**The liquid staked tokens Solayer is including at launch for restaking:**

Marinade-SOL (mSOL)\
JITO-SOL (JITO-SOL)\
Blaze-SOL (bSOL)\
MarginFi-SOL (mSOL)

Solayer will monitor for other potential LSTs to be added into the restaking bucket. Please reach out to _team@solayer.org_ if there is room for collaboration.&#x20;

**Step 1: navigate to app.solayer.org**&#x20;

Step 3: Enter the amount you would like to restake for token approval

Step 4: Confirm deposit &#x20;

Step 5: Points will begin to accrue at the point of restaking&#x20;

Step 6: At a given point of withdrawal, a portion of the points will be penalized before the launch of node operators&#x20;
