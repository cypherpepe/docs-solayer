### 2024 April Audit&#x20;

Security is a core development effort of Solayer's long-hauled commitment to building secure and scalable crypto-economic infrastructure. Here we present our first audit report:&#x20;

Despite having thorough security reviews, we encourage community members, technical hackers, and researchers to comprehensively review the contracts, and report to `report@solayer.org`, or via proper channels if any bugs have been identified.&#x20;

Lastly, Solayer will conduct two audits per year on all existing contracts.&#x20;
