# Audits

Security is a core development effort of Solayer's long-hauled commitment to building secure and scalable crypto-economic infrastructure. Here we present 2 audit reports:&#x20;

1. Ottersec
2. C4&#x20;

Despite having thorough security reviews, we encourage community members, technical hackers, and researchers to comprehensively review the contracts, and report to `report@solayer.org`, or via proper channels if any bugs have been identified.&#x20;
