#### Liquid Staking vs Native Staking

1. **Native Staking:** In native staking, users directly stake their tokens the consensus layer to support network security and earn staking rewards. Once staked, staked tokens are locked for a certain period and cannot be easily accessed or traded. Users usually run Solana validator node to natively stake to secure the network.&#x20;
2. **Liquid Staking:** Liquid staking addresses the liquidity issue by issuing a representative token (such as an LST) in exchange for the staked tokens. These representative tokens can be traded, used in DeFi protocols, or even staked further while the original tokens remain locked in the staking contract. This allows users to maintain liquidity and participate in other opportunities without sacrificing their staking rewards.

2. **Native Staking:** Native staking allows you to stake SOL and earn the network yield, which is about 8% at the time of writing.
