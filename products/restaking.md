# Restaking

#### Liquid Staking vs Native Staking

1. **Native Staking:** In native staking, users directly stake their tokens the consensus layer to support network security and earn staking rewards. Once staked, staked tokens are locked for a certain period and cannot be easily accessed or traded. Users usually run Solana validator node to natively stake to secure the network.&#x20;
2. **Liquid Staking:** Liquid staking addresses the liquidity issue by issuing a representative token (such as an LST) in exchange for the staked tokens. These representative tokens can be traded, used in DeFi protocols, or even staked further while the original tokens remain locked in the staking contract. This allows users to maintain liquidity and participate in other opportunities without sacrificing their staking rewards.

#### Liquid Restaking vs Native Restaking

1. **Liquid** **Restaking**: the process of depositing liquid staking tokens (LSTs) into the Solayer smart contracts. At this time, the protocol supports the following LSTs:

* mSOL (marginSOL)
* bSOL
* JITO-SOL&#x20;
* mSOL (marinadeSOL)

2. **Native** **Restaking**: Native restaking describes the process of setting an Solana validator's withdraw Credential to Solayer's smart contracts (SolayerPod). You must operate an Solana Validator node in order to participate in Native Restaking.

If you would like to have your LST included in the Solayer restaking platform, please fill out this form:&#x20;

## Introducing Liquid Restaking Token

Traditionally, restaked assets, whether liquid or native, are locked and thus inaccessible for trading or use on other platforms. Solayer introduces Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) that remains accessible while being restaked to validate other services. Users who restake and receive LRT in the form of sSOL can actively participate in various DeFi platforms. Currently, sSOL is listed on the following exchanges:
