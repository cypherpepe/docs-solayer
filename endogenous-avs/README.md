# Endogenous AVS

Solayer is a restaking marketplace developed on Solana. Instead of focusing on exogenous AVSs (such as oracles and bridges on EigenLayer), Solayer aims to support on-chain decentralized applications (dApps) initially. The goal is to provide dApps on Solana with a greater likelihood of securing block space and prioritizing transaction inclusion. These are referred to as endogenous AVSs.&#x20;
