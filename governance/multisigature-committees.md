# Multisigature Committees

Solayer DAO is governed via the three-prong to ensure trustless checks and balances: Treasury, Operations, and Emergency. In addition, the Solayer smart contracts are upgradable by functionality, as well as other adjustable parameters, such as the ability to pause or upgrade. The three committes oversee protocol upgrades, adjustments, and emergency pauses.&#x20;

### Operational Multisigature

The operational multisig oversees one of the core developments of Solayer Governance. It is a 3/5 threshold multisig that can execute routine upgrades and maintenance that enforce a minimum 7-day delay on all safety-critical actiosn. It can also pause Solayer contracts in emergency situations.&#x20;

### Treasury Multisigature&#x20;

The Community Multisig is a 9/13 multisig composed of members of the cryptoeconomic community. In normal circumstances, the signers of the Community Multisig will simply act as observers, receiving regular updates on the Operations Multisigâ€™s transactions, including notifications of the Operations Multisig queuing new time-locked actions. In extraordinary circumstances, the Community Multisig can perform emergency actions, including immediately executing time-critical upgrades or replacing the Operations Multisig in the event of private key compromise.

Members include:&#x20;
