# Introduction

**Solayer**: the shared validator network on Solana through the restaking collective.

Solayer is Solana's own restaking protocol.

#### Why use Solayer?[​](https://docs.solayer.org/#why-use-solayer) <a href="#why-use-solayer" id="why-use-solayer"></a>

Solana users who have staked their SOL either natively or with a liquid staking service, and who are also seeking additional rewards on top of their staking rewards, may benefit from committing their already-staked assets to Solayer's restaking protocol. In doing so, they will contribute to the security of a multitude of decentralized applications which will each repay the favor with some reward for users.

Developers interested in creating new decentralized applications that require networks of validators, may find that by using Solayer they can focus on building their applications instead of launching new trust networks from scratch. These services built with Solayer will also benefit from superior economic security than if they had launched their own network of validators.



### **What is shared validator network?**

Eigenlayer initiated the restaking concept on Ethereum, allowing ETH to be used as a restake asset to bolster the security of other networks. Building on this innovation, Solayer emerges as a shared validator network aimed at enhancing the security mechanisms of decentralized networks, beginning with Solana. Rather than creating new assets or chains, restaking leverages the established economic security of networks like Ethereum and Solana. This approach provides an efficient and interoperable system that significantly scales up economic security across the blockchain ecosystem.

### The rudimentary problems of cryptoeconomic security

As the blockchain landscape expands with the emergence of more Layer 1 networks, we're witnessing not just a fragmentation of liquidity but also a dispersion of decentralized trust. The collateral used in these networks is typically dedicated solely to securing the Layer 1, neglecting other decentralized or off-chain services. This leads to inefficiencies in both liquidity and trust. Moreover, the inherent design of Proof of Stake (PoS) systems requires developers to establish a network effect of trust: liquidity, validators, investors, and more, to ensure the network's integrity and functionality. The analogy applies to the same as rather than building on top of AWS, developers need to set up their own development infrastructure, from operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services.

### **Solana’s unique advantage**

Solayer aims to become a market leader in shared security protocols by leveraging its first-mover advantage, fast execution environment, and strong community alignment. With the ability to leverage Solana's parallel processing and high-speed execution, Solayer is well-suited for computationally intensive applications like gaming and AI/ML. Its competitive pricing and low latency make it a strong contender against other restaking platforms. Solana's large and decentralized proof-of-stake chain, with a market capitalization of over $35 billion and more than 1,400 nodes, provides a solid foundation for Solayer. The introduction of MEV-Boost to the Solana ecosystem through Solayer could enhance block construction efficiency and increase yield advantages, making Solana staking even more attractive. Solayer's speed and pricing advantages are expected to enable new applications beyond traditional security constraints. With full ecosystem support from Solana to Eigenlayer and the potential for the fastest execution environment with upcoming off-chain compute and ZK co-processors, Solayer is poised to offer high-quality security and attract active users for application developers.
