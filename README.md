Solayer is building the restaking network natively on Solana.&#x20;

Solana as the _internet_ layer provides how data, trust, and money travel. Solayer leverages its economic security and premium execution as the _decentralized cloud infrastructure_ to enable a higher degree of consensus and blockspace customization for _application_ developers.

To realize this, Solayer is a two-pronged approach:&#x20;

1. **Restaking**: â€Œleverage the economic security of SOL to secure other systems
2. **Shared Validator Network**: Solana-centric networks sharing Solana security and infrastructure&#x20;

The Solayer team is developing the core primitives around modular shared security, and will open-source in 3 main stages.&#x20;
