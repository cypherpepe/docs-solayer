# Delegation

Running software to validate a variety of AVS protocols is a task that is best left for sophisticated users who are capable of running the software efficiently and reducing the risk of service distruption. Users simply looking to receive rewards for committing their assets to be restaked may not be sufficiently sophisticated operators of AVS software to operate it safely. Or, users might simply prefer to avoid the inconvenience of running AVS software themselves.

In any case, it is possible for users restaking their assets to delegate the operation of AVS software to a sophisticated entity willing to operate the AVS software on their behalf.
