# Native SOL Restaking

For native SOL restaking, Solayer first converts your SOL to an intermediary form called sSOL-raw, which is the Liquid Staking Token (LST) issued by the stake pool manager. This entire process is non-custodial, ensuring that staked SOL is delegated to validators who earn MEV-boosted returns. The sSOL-raw is then converted to sSOL after another interaction with the Solayer restaking pool manager. All these steps are executed in a single transaction for efficiency.
