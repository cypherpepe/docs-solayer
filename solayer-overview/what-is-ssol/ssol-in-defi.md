# sSOL in DeFi

_There are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL Holder. You can delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth or participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners._

_Now we will go through a couple of examples on how you can put your sSOL to work in AMMs, lending protocols, perpetual exchanges, and more._

***

### 1. Liquidity Vaults on Kamino

Kamino's liquidity vaults are an automated liquidity solution that allows users to earn yield on their crypto assets by providing liquidity to concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs).

A vault deploys liquidity into an underlying DEX pool, consisting of 2 tokens. When you deposit into a vault, you earn fees from trading volume.&#x20;

In other words, if you deposit into a pool with sSOL and SOL, any token swaps that utilize that pool will incur a small cost to the swapper. As a Kamino depositor, you earn from that swap fee.

**Vault Capital Deposit Example**

**Situation**: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.

**Use Case**: Deposit your sSOL into a Kamino vault. Your sSOL will provide liquidity to a DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Kamino automates rebalancing and compounding, maximizing your yield.

**Benefit**: Earn yield passively while maintaining exposure to sSOL.

### 2. Collateral on Drift&#x20;

sSOL can be used as collateral in Drift Protocol's decentralized money markets. You can deposit sSOL to earn yield or borrow against it at a variable interest rate.

Lenders earn yield on their sSOL deposits by providing liquidity, while borrowers access liquidity pools in an over-collateralized manner. Interest earned is vested immediately and compounds automatically.

Let’s go through an example where an sSOL holder borrows against this position.&#x20;

**Borrowing Example**

**Situation**: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want access to USDC but don't want to sell your sSOL.

**Use Case**: Deposit your sSOL into Drift and borrow up to 50% of its value in USDC. For 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD, you can borrow up to $5,000 USDC.

**Benefit**: The borrowed amount can be used for anything, including leveraged exposure to particular assets via spot trading.

### 3. Liquidity Provision on Orca

Orca utilizes a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) to enhance capital efficiency and yield for liquidity providers. By providing liquidity to Orca's pools, users can earn yield on their crypto assets through trading fees.

When you provide liquidity to an Orca pool, such as the sSOL-SOL pair, you earn fees from each token swap within that pool. This means if you deposit sSOL and SOL into the pool, any trades that occur between these tokens will generate fees, which are distributed to you as a liquidity provider. Orca automates this process, ensuring optimal capital efficiency and low slippage.

**LP Example**

**Situation**: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.

**Use Case**: Deposit your sSOL and an equivalent amount of SOL into an Orca CLAMM pool. Your sSOL and SOL will provide liquidity to the DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Orca’s advanced CLAMM technology will ensure that your assets are utilized efficiently, maximizing your returns.

**Benefit**: Earn yield passively from trading fees while maintaining exposure to both sSOL and SOL.

### 4. Spot Trading on Drift&#x20;

Drift allows traders to buy or sell spot assets directly with immediate delivery and on-chain settlement. By sourcing liquidity from OpenBook DEX and Drift’s decentralized limit order book (DLOB), Drift ensures access to the best prices and trading opportunities.&#x20;

Drift's Just-In-Time (JIT) auction mechanism further enhances on-chain liquidity by initiating auctions where market makers compete to offer the best price for market or limit orders. If no offers are made within five seconds, the trade proceeds through Drift’s AMM, combining various liquidity mechanisms for optimal spot liquidity.

**Exchange Example**

**Situation**: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to capitalize on immediate market movements and manage your risk exposure.

**Use Case**: You can directly trade sSOL against other assets, sourcing liquidity from OpenBook DEX and Drift’s DLOB.&#x20;

**Benefit**: Effectively manage risk by balancing your positions and potentially earning from market movements, while maintaining real-time account balance updates.

| _Collateral_              | You can use sSOL as a collateral on various money markets and borrow against it. This way you can either unlock more capital or directly leverage your position.           |
| _Borrowed Asset_          | sSOL can also be borrowed from available liquidity pools in an over-collateralized fashion.                                                                                |
| _Liquidity Provisioning_  | You will be able to provide sSOL to a number of vaults in DeFi in order to earn additional yield on top of your holdings.                                                  |
| _Trading_                 | sSOL is available on Raydium and Orca, so you can easily trade it for other tokens on Solana. Keep in mind that trading sSOL may result in your stopping to earn rewards.  |
