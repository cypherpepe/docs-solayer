# Audits

Security is a core development effort of Solayer's long-hauled commitment to building secure and scalable crypto-economic infrastructure. Here we present our audit reports:&#x20;

1. [OtterSec](https://github.com/solayer-labs/token-metadata/blob/07981c9059f64b50132a67c9db57219ed194678d/audit.pdf): April, 2024 Audit
2. [OtterSec](https://github.com/solayer-labs/solayer-improvement-proposal/blob/main/audits/OtterSec-audit-report-restaking-program.pdf): July, 2024 Audit&#x20;

Despite having thorough security reviews, we encourage community members, technical hackers, and researchers to comprehensively review the contracts, and report to `report@solayer.org`, or via proper channels if any bugs have been identified.&#x20;

Lastly, Solayer will conduct two audits per year on all existing contracts.&#x20;
